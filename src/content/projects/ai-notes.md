A context-aware knowledge base featuring an AI chat interface. Unlike standard note apps, it utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to allow users to ask AI questions about their own notes. The system leverages the Gemini API and Vercel AI SDK to analyze stored content and generate relevant answers or create new notes on the fly
