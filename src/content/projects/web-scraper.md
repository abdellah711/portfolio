I created this sofisticated web scraper for a local client to extract data from multiple sources. The scraperâ€™s frontend was built using React (with vite), while the backend was powered by Express. I used MongoDB to store the extracted data and Redis to manage job queues (using Bull.js package) since the web scraper is a long-running process. one of the scraping techniques requires a headless browser, I used Puppeteer which introduced deployment challenges and to resolve them, I containerized the application with Docker ensuring smooth and efficient deployment
