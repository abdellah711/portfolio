I've often struggled with creating themes for my shadcn projects because shadcn use HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values for CSS theme variables, without utilizing the CSS hsl() function. This made it difficult for my IDE to recognize the variables as colors, and adjusting them became a hassle.
To solve this issue, I developed a tool to simplify the process of creating themes for Shadcn UI projects by allowing users to adjust the HSL values using a user-friendly interface and visualize how the theme will look in real-time.
